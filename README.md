# FantasyAdventure
A desktop java app that is the beginnings and shell of an RPG, inspired from Baulder's Gate.  
CGen and interface complete, left the project at the action screen.

## History
This was my first programming project after college to teach myself Java.  The version of Java used was very old, and thus many of the components used are rudimentary and manually configured.  I ran into significant challenges when I got to the action screen, which is where this project stalled out and other efforts around drawing loops were pursued.

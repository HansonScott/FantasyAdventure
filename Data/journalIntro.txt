Welcome to your personal journal.  The purpose of this area of the journal is to allow you to write in whatever material you would like.  If you want to remember a place for some reason, or remember a character interaction you had, or perhaps just log what adventures you have had.  Use the buttons on the left to navigate through all the possible topics and options available. The <add new topic> button allows you to separate parts of your journal for clarity and organization. The <delete current topic> allows you to delete an entire topic, if you so desire. One point to note: any changes you make will save when you save your session, so the journal will be attached directly to the save game, not to the character in general.  If you decide to backtrack using previous saves, the journal will revert as well.  Have fun!

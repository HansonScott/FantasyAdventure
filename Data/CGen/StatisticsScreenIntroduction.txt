Step two of the character generation process is to establish your character's physical, mental and spiritual statistics.  1) Choose your style of attribute creation.  Click on the three different styles to read their descriptions.  2) Click the 'Roll' button to set the dice for your beginning stats.  3) If you choose the Buy style, assign your points to the dice using the (+) and (-) buttons.  4)  Assign a die to each attribute by clicking on a die to highlight it, then clicking on an attribute to assign the die to that attribute.  It is advisable to assign the highest die value to their character's primary attribute, followed by the lowest die values according to the character strengths and weaknesses they would like to play.  Then analyze any secondary benefits or penalties of the remaining few statistics to determine their values.  The bonuses you will receive during the game are listed in the box to the right, combined with your race bonuses from your race choice from the genetics screen.

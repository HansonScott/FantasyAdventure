Dexterity is the prime attribute for all ranged weapon users such as the archer or thief.  Dexterity affects the character's accuracy with ranged and melee weapons and also affects the character's balance in combat and in general. A high Dexterity value gives the character a bonus to their reflexes, allowing him or her to dodge and avoid an attack from an enemy, both physical and certain types of magical attacks. Both launcher and thrown weapons have a substantial minimum Dexterity requirement to be used effectively.

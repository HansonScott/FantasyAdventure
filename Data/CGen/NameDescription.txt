The name you choose will be attached with your character and will be known to others by it.  Clicking on the suggest name button will give a race-appropriate name example.  The full name is the character's official title, and will be used for official business and formal address.  The short name, usually the character's 'first' name is used for daily interaction and common conversation.  Sometimes characters will go by a totally different common name, despite their official full name, which is why there are two different fields for you to customize your character's two names.

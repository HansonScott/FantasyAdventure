Stealth and Social skills are fundamental for any rogue class character.  Drawing primarily from Dexterity and Charisma, the skills in this list will aid your character in all manner of evasion, stealth, and tactical strategy.  Be sure to read the entire list and plan your character carefully, as rogue characters are incredibly diverse and unique.  Be sure to match up your skills as you train them: detecting traps and picking locks work well together as do stealth and backstab or snipe.

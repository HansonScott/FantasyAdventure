Female Halfling names often end with an "o," while male halfling names often end with an "a."  This is exactly opposite the tendency of most mannish names.  As such, when Halfling names are rendered into human languages the endings are often switched.  Thus the male name Fosca becomes Fosco in most every human language. Halflings generally have a middle and a last name.  They usually go by all three names in everyday conversation.  Carl Palladin Merribuck is a famous example of this tendency.  Halflings take pride in their last names because the names designate family and region of where they live.  Only halflings really know how to decipher the names in this manner however. Some say that the halflings just have every possible halfling family name memorized in their heads. First names are given at birth and tend to repeat from father to son, or skip a generation. For households with multiple children, it is common to start naming the kids after aunts and uncles. New names only seem to come into the mix when heroic deeds are performed by someone the halflings admire, though this is a rarity.

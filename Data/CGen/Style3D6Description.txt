The 3D6 Style of character development is the classic style of rolling 3 six-sided dice and adding their total to get each of the six character attributes.  Voluntarily restricting yourself to the very first roll that comes up would be a true hardcore Role Playing experience, forcing you to play the character that is randomly rolled for you.  Choosing which die to assign to each attribute becomes that much more critical because the chance of getting multiple bonuses for all your character's primary attributes is rare indeed.

Dwarves are much like humans, but generally living underground or in mountainous areas. Here they have heaped up countless treasures of gold, silver, and precious stones, and pass their time in fabricating costly armor. They are famed miners and smiths although, like humans, they specialize in any number of trades. Generally shorter than humans, they are on average stockier and hairier, usually sporting full beards. Dwarvish smiths created some of the greatest and most famous items of power.  Dwarves gain a bonus to their constitution, but incur a penalty to their charisma.  Dwarves also gain a bonus to their Fortification, Fire and Earth saves.

Constitution is the attribute governing bodily health. Constitution determines the number of hit points (life) the character will have, and thus determine how much damage can be sustained before becoming unconscious or dying in battle. Constitution is a primary attribute for all characters who will be involved in any type of physical combat. Constitution also affects the character's ability to resist poisons and diseases as well as determine the rate at which the character's body regenerates and heals itself of damage.

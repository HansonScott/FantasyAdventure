Chaotic Good, “Rebel”: A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he’s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good combines a good heart with a free spirit.  A good-hearted thief fits this category well.  Using stealth, picking pockets, lockpicks, breaking and entering, etc., all fit the chaotic side, but as to the actual damage or suffering that is caused, a chaotic good thief may break into a wealthy nobel's house and take nothing, leaving only a note telling of personal pride or accomplishment.  Certainly such an aligned character would never steal from the poor, but only from those who, in this character's opinion, don't need or appreciate the money as much as the thief would.

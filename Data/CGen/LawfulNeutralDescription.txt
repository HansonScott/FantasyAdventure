Lawful Neutral, “Judge”: A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs. Order and organization are paramount as well. This character may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or he or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government. Lawful neutral means expressing reliability and honor without being a zealot.  Many commoners would be considered lawful neutral as they obey laws, but act in their own best interests within that law, not necessarily going out of their way to help others.

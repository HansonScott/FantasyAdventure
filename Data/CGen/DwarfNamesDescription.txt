Dwarf names are a combination of diverse first name, and a last name that describes a quality or notable trait of either the specific Dwarf, or of the clan from which the Dwarf hails.  Often the last name is a combination of an adjective and a noun.  Words chosen for the last name should reflect strong, confident standing.  Any combination of tools, geography, or slaign foes are encouraged. (Dwarf names are chosen randomly from a premade list of first names, combined with a random choice of last names.)

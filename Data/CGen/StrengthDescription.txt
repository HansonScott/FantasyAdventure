Strength is the prime attribute for melee weapon characters such as the fighter, berserker, paladin, etc. Strength affects the character's melee damage in battle as well as allow your character to wield heavy weapons and armor, which have a minimum Strength requirement. A high Strength attribute allows the character to carry a large inventory without becoming winded or impaired by the weight. Strength also determines the character's ability to move or lift heavy objects.

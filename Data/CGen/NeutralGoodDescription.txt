Neutral Good, “Benefactor”: A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. They are devoted to helping others, working with kings and magistrates as well as commoners and the poor.  Neutral good means doing what is good without bias for or against order.  Many commoners hold to this alignment because they choose to act kindly to their neighbor, obey laws in public and as they are forced to, but avoid laws or even deliberatly break laws in private or when they know they will get away with them.

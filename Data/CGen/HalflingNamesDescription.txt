Halfling names are much more descriptive of the Halfing rather than an abstract symbol or meaning.  Many first names are given after birth, describing the basic character of the individual.  Last names are a combination of a prefix and suffix.  Usually the last name is a combination of adjective and noun, relating to the family trade, quality, or geographical relationship.  Male and female first names are unique. (First names are randomly drawn from a premade list; last names are generated from a random premade prefix and random premade suffix.)

The Buy Style of character development comes from the theory of custom character creation, instead of random rolling.  The number of points you begin your purchasing is set by a subjective average roll that is taken by players rolling 3D6.  This allows you to highly stack bonuses on a few die and leaving severe penalties in others.  This style is used to create a wildly customized character, with may be much more exciting to play depending on the die values you choose.   The die adjustment buttons are activated for this style of attribute rolling.  You begin with a default value for each die, then you can choose to adjust each die value up or down manually.

Welcome to the character generation process. This is the first screen in a series of detail screens to create your new main character.  Think about the character you would like to play before you begin, so you can plan your choices along the way.  In this screen, choose your race and gender first, which will determine what picture choices are given to you.  The two name fields do not have to match at all, but it is common to have just the first name in the 'short name' box.  If you would like suggestions for race-specific names, click the 'suggest name' button. Have fun!

The age you set for your character will have impact on a few different areas throughout the game.  Your character's initial fame is slightly adjusted by age, as an older member of a community will be slightly better known than a younger member.  At the extreme ages, your stats will be slightly affected, in that a 1 year old will not be able to achieve the same wisdom as an elder.  A character that is older than the average lifespan will begin to see increased wisdom and intellignece, but decreased strength and constitution because of their age.

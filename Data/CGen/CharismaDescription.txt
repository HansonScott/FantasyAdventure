Charisma is a character's ability to present themselves physically and socially to others. Monsters and other non-social beings have no regard for charisma. Charisma affects the character's ability to make allies and convince others of a particular agenda. The character's appearance and social graces are governed by Charisma and will affect any social interaction in the realm. The number of people who will join your party is also affected by your charisma. A high Charisma may allow the character to avoid confrontations leading to battle, or even to turn the tide of political turmoil.

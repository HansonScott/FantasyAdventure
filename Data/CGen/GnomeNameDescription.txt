Gnomish names indicate the gnome's caste.  The first part of the name is the given name followed by the caste name which is the name of the ancestor that spawned the caste.  Gnomes are usually given their names by the age of five.  Amongst almost all Gnomish sub-cultures, the mother is responsible for naming her child.  Mothers deliberate long and hard over their child’s name and rarely decide quickly.  Thus gnomes often receive their names years after birth.  If a mother hasn’t decided on her child’s name by his or her fifth birthday, the elders usually step in, as the fifth birthday of a gnome is considered an auspicious and sacred time.

Neutral is the denial of the values of Law and Chaos, or Good and Evil.  A character may be neutral in the moral dimension or the ethical dimension or both; neutrality in both dimensions is called True Neutral.  Neutrality takes three essential forms:  pragmatic, oblivious, and druidic.  The pragmatic neutral considers certain things to be merely tools, to be used to promote other values.  Thus, a Lawful (pragmatic) Neutral believes that good and evil are both useful tools in the promotion of Law, and a (pragmatic) Neutral Good believes that law and chaos may both be used to promote Good.  The oblivious neutral is unaware of the meaning of certain values. Thus, a Chaotic Neutral could be so dedicated to the notion of individual freedom, that good and evil are meaningless concepts used by others to cloud the essential issue of independence, and a Neutral Evil could imagine that ideas of Law and Chaos are merely the efforts of others to steal his wealth or power.  The Druidic Neutral believes that in the nature of the world, certain things are or should be in balance, either by design or by the continued conflicts of equal opposing forces.  Thus, a (Druidic) Neutral Good or a (Druidic) Neutral Evil would make an effort to balance structure and freedom, and a Lawful (Druidic) Neutral or Chaotic (Druidic) Neutral would similarly attempt to balance good and evil.

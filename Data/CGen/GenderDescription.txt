Your gender choice will make a significant impact on your game play.  There is no advantage per say of choosing one over the other in either statistics or skills, but your choice will impact the reactions you get from other charaacters depending on their gender in comparison to yours.  Although a society strives for gender equality in principle, there is always significant differences in practice among locals and more common layers of society.  Combine this fact with your character’s Charisma statistic, and your character will be treated uniquely, for good or bad.

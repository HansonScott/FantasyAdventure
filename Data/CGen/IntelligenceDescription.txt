Intelligence is the prime attribute of magic-wielding characters. The total amount and therefore regeneration rate of magic points (mana) is determined in part by the character's Intelligence. Intelligence also affects the character's ability to understand and comprehend complex situations whether they are puzzles, conversations, foreign languages, and ancient lore.

Half-Orcs are not famous for their intellect, so their names are quite simple, usually one or two syllables.  A few Half-Orc mages or more intelligent Half-Orc have three or four syllables.  The sounds within Half-Orc names are usually more gutteral, usually with an abundance of the sound: B, D, G, K, R, and Z.  Vowel sounds are centered around: O, U. (the ones suggested are from a premade list and not generated dynamically.)

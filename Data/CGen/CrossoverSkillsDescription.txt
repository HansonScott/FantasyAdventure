This list of skill points is available for your character to train any of the three skill categories.  This allows your character to achieve some basic skills in each category, even if your character does not have a statistic bonus in that area, and thus does not receive any skill points in that area.  Note that your character will still need to have the minimum requirements in order to train a skill, but this allows even a mage with low Strength or constitution to learn a weapon familiarization.  You can, however, use these crossover skill points to further your character's primary area of training.  This can make your character much more defined and excellent in a specific area.

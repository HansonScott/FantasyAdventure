The trained skills panel below lists all the skills your character has trained so far.  Initially blank, your character must choose skills from the skills available panel on the left and click the 'add skill' button to train that particular skill.  Once trained, it will be reflected on this panel.  Note that a skill may have another skill as a prerequisite, so read and choose carefully.

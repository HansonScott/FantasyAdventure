Dragons are fantasic creatures.  Excelling in just about everything, dragons are a sight to behold.  Many are hunted for sport or fame, as they are powerful foes in any setting.  One would be well advised to stay in the good graces of dragons, or else approach them with a well-equipped and prepared party.

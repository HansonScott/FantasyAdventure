Choosing a character alignment is essential for establishing the character's choice of action throughout the game.  Your alignment should direct the character's choices and will affect how people react to the character.  Over time, as the character continues to make choices and to establish certain patterns, the alignment will either solidify or perhaps it may change if the actions performed by the character do not match up with the initial chosen alignment.

Good, in game terms, is the belief in the promotion of the general well-being of all creatures.  It is, at times, necessary that those who oppose this should be forcibly stopped, even killed; but those who are good will avoid causing unnecessary suffering, and will only resort to violence when it is necessary and justifiable.  In monetary terms, good characters tend to spread wealth around, and will only hoard money on the justification that the character will ultimately be able to use the money to further good, such as by buying a ship to pursue pirates, or building a keep or fortress to defend the local peasants, or constructing a chapel to further the worship of good deities and provide a focal point for charity.  Evil is characterized by selfishness and purpose.  It maintains that it is both important and correct that those who are worthy should succeed, while the weak and unworthy perish.  The efforts of good to distribute wealth generally are viewed as cheating the truly deserving.  Evil characters do not regard other characters--not even other evil characters--as worthy of respect.  They are always willing to take advantage of another's misfortune.  Any generous act, either by giving away treasure or by taking risks on behalf of another, must be justified by some advantage to the character taking the action.  Evil characters often believe that good and neutral characters are pretending they are not evil in order to fool others and gain an advantage.

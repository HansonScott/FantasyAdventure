Note on Orcish names: Orcs almost never have more than one name.  The names are generally as harsh and unattractive as they are.  They also vary widely according to the tribe of orcs.  The names are combinations of words from Black Speech and the mannish tongues, as well as simple sounds.  There are no differences between male and female Orcish names.

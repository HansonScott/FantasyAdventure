Human names are by far the most broad, most unique race names.  Because Humans have so many sub-races, names can vary greatly to reflect the family or geographic origin of the Human.  Male and female names are generally seperate, although a few names do cross gender. (The names for Humans are randomly drawn from a premade list, from www.babynames.com)

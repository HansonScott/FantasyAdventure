Neutral Evil, “Malefactor”: neutral evil villains do whatever they can get away with, and a bit more. Out for themselves, pure and simple. they shed no tears for those killed, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. Neutral evil characters have no love of order nor hold illusion of following laws, traditions, or codes. On the other hand, these characters don’t have the restless nature or love of conflict that chaotic evil villains have. Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies. Neutral evil is a dangerous alignment because it represents pure evil without honor or variation.

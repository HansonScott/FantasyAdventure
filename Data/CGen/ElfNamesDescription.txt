Elven names are unique and exquisit.  Because of their lineage and etherial nature, many Elven names are lengthy and contain phonems that focus on the flow of the name, or elegance of it.  The full names of Elves portray their lineage or allegence.  The last name may consist of a former teacher or parent, as well as geographic names, which sound very similar.  The short, common name is often a shortening of the full first name. (Elf names are generated by combining a randomly chosen prefix with 1-3 randomly chosen suffixes.  This name is then combined with a randomly chosen linking phrase, followed by another randomly generated name.)

Wisdom is the prime attribute of clerics and other characters of spiritual connection. Wisdom allows a character to connect with their inner soul and learn from their experiences. Wisdom affects how much experience you gain from your actions as well as aid in mana calculations. Total mana points are also determined in part by the character's Wisdom attribute. A high Wisdom attribute will benefit all characters in their progression of skills and application of knowledge. The skill 'Turn Undead' uses the character's wisdom bonus to aid in overcoming an undead opponent.

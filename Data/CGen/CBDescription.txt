Combat and Battle skills are fundamental for any warrior class character.  Drawing primarily from Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, the skills in this list will aid your character in melee combat as well as overall hardiness and advanced weapon specialization.  When choosing weapon skills, avoid spending skills on many different weapons, but rather specializing in just a choice few.  Weapons are very diverse throughout the realm, and you will have no trouble finding a wide range of both common and powerful weapons of all types.

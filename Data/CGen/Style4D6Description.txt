The 4D6 Style of character development originates from classic 'hero' stats.  Because you are choosing to play a hero, your character will have superior attributes over that of a commoner.  Taking this fact into account, the 4D6 style uses 4 six-sided dice and adds the top three values, disregarding the lowest.  This is a more common style to achieve multiple attribute bonuses and make the game a bit easier in general, especially in the beginning.

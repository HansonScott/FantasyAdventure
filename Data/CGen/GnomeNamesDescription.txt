Gnome names are made by combining a prefix, a suffix, and a clan, all into the same word.  There is, however, a gender difference in the clan ending.  Common casual or 'first' names for Gnomes often are simply shortened forms of their full name, or perhaps a play on words from their name, phonetically. (Gnome names are generated by combining three random choices from premade prefixes, suffixes, and clan names.)
